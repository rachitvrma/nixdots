* Convert JSON files to Nix files

We can [[https://github.com/theobori/nix-converter][nix-converter]], but recently it's been writing double quotes around nix keys. So we can use native nix tooling as well.

#+begin_src shell
    
  $nix-instantiate --eval --expr "builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./file.json)"
  
#+end_src

Just place the name of the json file in place of =file.json=.
