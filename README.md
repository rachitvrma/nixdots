> [!NOTE]
> See the [steps to install niri using binary cache.](#when-using-the-niri-wm) This repo uses niri from the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) repository.

> [!NOTE]
> I have taken a heavy inspiration from [vimjoyer's nixconf repo](https://github.com/vimjoyer/nixconf). However, I have not put to use the wrapper's configuration. I am still using home-manager, because it solves a lot of problems that would rather need to be solved manually when using wrappers.

# 📔 Instructions for installation

I am presuming that a bootable USB is already prepared. Boot into the computer.

## 🧪Enable Experimental Features

Experimental features are not enabled in NixOS by default. It can be enabled by exporting the `NIX_CONFIG` variable. It can also be enabled by passing the `--extra-experimental-features` flag to `nix` command utility in NixOS.

First enter into a root shell.

```bash
$ sudo -i
```

Run this to enable flakes and the nix-command utility.

```bash
$ export NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
```

## ↙️ Clone this Repo

Clone it into `/tmp`.

```bash
$ mkdir -p /tmp
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rachitve6h2g/nixdots.git
```

## 💾 Run Disko to Prepare Disks

Disko is available in the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) repository. But it is advisable to run the latest commit from the [nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) github repo. This repository has the ability to support multiple users and hosts. Make sure that the `disko-config.nix` belongs to the correct host. By default, it's for [nixpavilion](modules/nixosModules/hosts/nixpavilion/), the default host machine that I use. Every host has a `disko-config.nix` file, which is a hard-coded disk layout configuration for each host. There may be a future configuration where I might enable multiple disk layouts. But it's not a very common thing that users choose different disk layouts for the same host every time they re-install for the same host.

```bash
$ cd /tmp/nixdots/modules/nixosModules/hosts/nixpavilion
```

For now, use the [disko-config for nixpavilion](modules/nixosModules/hosts/nixpavilion/disko-config.nix) for installation.

```bash
$ nix run github:nix-community/disko/latest -- --mode destroy,format,mount ./disko-config.nix
```

This will prompt for a password for the disk encryption set in the `disko-config.nix`.

## 🐧 OS Installation

Copy the cloned repo into `/mnt/etc/nixos`.

```bash
$ mkdir -p /mnt/etc
$ cp -r /tmp/nixdots /mnt/etc/nixos
```

Run the `nixos-install` command. It can be run with many flags. See `nixos-install --help` for useful flags. It is advisable to enable the `--no-root-passwd` in `nixos-install` if `users.users.<username>.initialPassword` option is set in `configuration.nix`.

```bash
$ nixos-install --no-root-passwd --root /mnt --cores 8 --max-jobs 1 --flake /mnt/etc/nixos#nixpavilion
```

It will not prompt for the password. Reboot after unmounting.

```bash
$ umount -R /mnt
$ reboot
```

You will land on the greeter. Follow the instructions further down.

## 💻 Post-OS-Installation

Home-Manager needs to be run first. Use `nh home switch` for installing our `user` level packages and `dotfiles`. In my personal experience, starting a desktop environment or a window manager (Hyprland in my default case) creates files that conflict with home-manager\'s generated files later on. It can be fixed instantly, either by running `nh home switch -- -b backup` or by manually deleting the conflicting files. I like to just jump to another tty, login and run `nh home switch` from there. However, follow these instructions in sequence.

### 🔒 Change user password

Remember that the password is global and hasn't changed. There's no root user yet. Change the current user password

```bash
$ passwd $USER
```

It will prompt for the current user password and for the new ones.

### 🏠 Bring `/etc/nixos` to `$HOME/nixdots`

`nh home switch` or `home-manager switch` will not run if the flake directory does not have user permission. By default, it's `root:root`. Link `$HOME/nixdots` to `/etc/nixos` so that the canonical structure is followed without being a hindrance.

```bash
$ cp -r /etc/nixos $HOME/nixdots
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/nixos
$ sudo ln -sf /home/$USER/nixdots /etc/nixos
```

Link `$HOME/nixdots` to `$HOME/.config/home-manager` so that it follows the canonical structure for `home-manager` commands like `home-manager news`, which is very handy for seeing new modules and options and stuff.

```bash
$ ln -sf $HOME/nixdots $HOME/.config/home-manager
```

Make sure that the home-manager option for `nh` i.e. `programs.nh.homeFlake` is still `/home/krish/nixdots`.

### Run the `nh home switch` command

Now that it is set up, run the `nh home switch` command to set up our `$HOME`.

```bash
$ nh home switch
```

Reboot for the environment variables to set. (In my experience, environment variables were never sourced when I logged out and just logged in).

### 🚶‍♂️ Further Steps.

1. Git actions

   Change the link from https://github.com/rachitve6h2g/nixdots.git to git@github.com:rachitve6h2g/nixdots.

2. Firefox

   Some Firefox extensions need to enabled manually. Some features are still not implemented by me. For example the Nord Extension has to be enabled manually.

## When Using the Niri Window Manager

For niri I use [niri-flake](https://github.com/sodiboo/niri-flake) by [sodiboo](https://github.com/sodiboo). It's popular and works well. To use niri-stable package from the binary cache of the author [these instructions](https://github.com/sodiboo/niri-flake#binary-cache) must be followed.

# Common issues

- On changing git repo, it may just stop working. Don't worry, remove all backup files and just rebuild.
- My NixOS bootloader malfunctioned once. I put up a query on [NixOS discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/). Here's [the solution](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-could-not-sync-boot-after-rebuild/74333/2?u=woodenallen).

# 🚧 Work In Progress

- [ ] Manage stylix themes from one place.
  - [ ] Place conditionals:
  - [ ] Wallpaper
  - [ ] Icon Theme
  - [ ] Cursor Theme

- [ ] Manage DE/WM

- [ ] Managing desktop environment and window manager from one place.

- [ ] Move to using wrappers.

- [x] Use import-tree and flake-parts to manage config as flake modules.

- [x] Create fuzzel scripts
  - [x] fuzzel_supermenu.sh - This will give a menu of menus.
  - [x] fuzzel_powermenu.sh - For poweroff and suspend and stuff.
  - [x] fuzzel_emoji.sh - For showing emoji selection.
  - [x] fuzzel_tomat.sh - For tomat pomodoro timer
  - [ ] fuzzel_fnottctl.sh - for fnott actions
  
- HALT: Flesh out neovim configuration. (Testing out helix and waiting for newer version of neovim with built-in package manager)
